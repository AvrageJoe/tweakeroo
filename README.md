**Tweakeroo is a client-side mod which adds a variety of different "tweaks" to the game, ranging from vanilla bug-fixes to quality-of-life changes which are sure to make your Minecraft experience even more enjoyable!**

>\
>There are many features that many server owners and admins consider "cheaty". Before using this mod on servers, ensure you know if certain features are disallowed.
>
>Some features may be automatically flagged by several anti-cheat systems. Most notably these include many of the clicking and block placing related features (including hand restock). This is likely due to item use or selected slot change packets being sent faster than the vanilla client typically would. Flexible Block Placement and Accurate Block Placement features work by clicking on the target position's air block, which can also be flagged by anti-cheat systems.

### Development Builds

There are (at least at times) developmental versions of my mods available [here](https://masa.dy.fi/mcmods/client_mods/?mcver=All&loader=any)

If you encounter bugs, try to update all the mods you have installed from the development page, as many bugs may have been fixed in newer versions
(There are at times changes in malilib or the mods that require both of them to be updated at the same time!)
